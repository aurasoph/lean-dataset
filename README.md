# lean-dataset
## Getting Started
These directions assume that you already have LEAN, lake, and elan installed. So far this has only been done on a Mac, so you may need to set up a codespace if not on Linux (see https://github.com/Vilin97/autoformalization-with-llms-fork).
1. Install poetry.
2. Run `poetry install --no-root`
3. To run a file run `poetry run python my/path/to/main.py`
